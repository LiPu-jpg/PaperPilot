- "Building on this, Jones [year] introduced Y, improving..."
- "However, these methods suffer from Z, as shown by..."

**Gap Identification:**
- "Despite these advances, several limitations remain:"
- "Current approaches have not addressed..."
- "An opportunity exists to combine X and Y..."

**Synthesis:**
- "Collectively, these studies suggest that..."
- "The evidence indicates a trend toward..."
- "Recent work has demonstrated..."
