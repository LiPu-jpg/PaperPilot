# Academic Writing Style Guide

Guidelines for writing clear, concise academic papers.

## Sentence Structure

### Prefer
- Active voice: "We train the model..." vs "The model is trained..."
- Short sentences: Break long sentences into shorter ones
- Direct statements: "We show that X improves Y" vs "It can be observed that X improves Y"

### Avoid
- Nominalization: Use verbs instead of nouns
  - "provide a description" → "describe"
  - "make a comparison" → "compare"
- Redundant phrases:
  - "In order to" → "To"
  - "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
  - "At this point in time" → "Now"

## Paragraph Construction

### Topic Sentence
First sentence should state the main idea:
```
The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on [task].
```

### Supporting Sentences
- Provide evidence
- Explain why
- Give examples

### Concluding Sentence
- Link to next paragraph
- Summarize key point

## Technical Writing

### Definitions
Define terms precisely on first use:
```
Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a neural architecture...
```

### Acronyms
Introduce on first use:
```
natural language processing (NLP)
deep learning (DL)
```

### Citations
- Use for facts, not your own contributions
- Don't over-cite well-known information
- Balance citations from recent and foundational work

## Common Issues

### Vague Language
| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "very", "really", "extremely" | Specific numbers |
| "good", "bad", "significant" | Quantified metrics |
| "improves performance" | "reduces error rate by 15%" |

### Hedging
Appropriate for:
- Preliminary results
- Uncertain findings
- Acknowledging limitations

Inappropriate for:
- Your main contributions
- Strong empirical results

### Paragraph Length
- Minimum: 2 sentences
- Maximum: ~200 words (split if longer)
